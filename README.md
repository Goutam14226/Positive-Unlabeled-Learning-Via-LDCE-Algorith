# Noise-robust Classification from Positive Unlabeled Data
Developed a binary classifier using positive &amp; unlabeled data, transforming it into a noise-robust learning model • Leveraging gradient descent and Langrange Var. method to generalise the model efficiently on unseen large dataset • Implemented the LDCE algorithm from scratch &amp; assessed model performance across binary &amp; multilabel datasets
